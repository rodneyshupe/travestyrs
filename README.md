# Travesty in Rust lang

A simple project for me to learn Rust Lang.  This analyzes input text and then
randomly generates text output based on the execution.

## History

My first exposure was via a Pascal program published in the [November Issue of Byte Magazine](https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-11/1984_11_BYTE_09-12_New_Chips#page/n129/mode/2up).
Since then I have implemented this algorithm to learn new languages.
